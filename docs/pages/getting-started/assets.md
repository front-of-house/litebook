# Static Assets

Built-in to Presta is support for static assets. Simply create a directory
called `/public` in the root of your project (where you run the Presta CLI from)
and add files there.

Any files added will be available at the root of your site i.e.
`/public/open-graph-image.jpg` will be served at `/open-graph-image.jpg`.
